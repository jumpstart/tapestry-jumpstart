	<h3>onActivate and onPassivate</h3>
	
	<h4>Rule of Thumb</h4>

	A good "rule of thumb" is to use onActivate(...) and onPassivate() for no more than receiving and returning the 
	activation context.<br/>
	In this page, for example, onActivate(...) receives a person id and onPassivate() returns a person id.<br/><br/>

	<p>It can be tempting to put setup code into onActivate(...) but avoid this because onActivate(...) is called very often. 
	There are better places:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>
		<code>setupRender()</code> is ideal for setting up objects and fields for display-only because Tapestry 
		calls it only during a <a href="http://tapestry.apache.org/page-navigation.html#PageNavigation-PageRenderRequests">
 		page render request</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>onPrepare()</code> is ideal for setting up objects and fields that can be edited in a Form because it 
		is triggered during form rendering and form submission but it isn't triggered by other 
		<a href="http://tapestry.apache.org/page-navigation.html#PageNavigation-ComponentEventRequests&amp;Responses">component event requests</a>. 
		If there's more than one form then use more than one onPrepare, eg. onPrepareFromFormX(), onPrepareFromFormY().
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>getters</strong> <em>can</em> be used for setting up objects and fields, but exercise caution 
		because they can be called more often than you expect. In this situation consider lazy-loading, eg. with 
		the method-level annotation <code>@Cached</code>. See 
		<a href="http://people.apache.org/~hlship/t5api/apidocs/org/apache/tapestry5/annotations/Cached.html">@Cached</a>.  
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	We <em>could</em> put code in onActivate(...) to validate access to the page, but there are better ways - see 
	the Protecting Pages example.<br/>
	
	<h4>When is onActivate(...) called?</h4>
	
	onActivate(...) is called in response to a page render request, a component event request, or when another page 
	calls a method on the page - which is typically to set it up before returning it. 
	onActivate(...)  is <em>not</em> called when a PageLink to the page is rendered.<br/><br/>
	
	A <a href="http://tapestry.apache.org/page-navigation.html#PageNavigation-PageRenderRequests">page render request</a> 
	can provide an activation context for the new page. 
	A <a href="http://tapestry.apache.org/page-navigation.html#PageNavigation-ComponentEventRequests&amp;Responses">component 
	event request</a> provides the activation context of the page it came from. 
	When another page calls a method on the page it is usually to set up the fields used in the activation context.<br/>

	<h4>When is onPassivate() called?</h4>
	
	<p>The purpose of onPassivate() is to return the activation context of the page instance. Tapestry calls onPassivate() in 
	these situations:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>when rendering a PageLink that does not specify a context.</li>
		<li>when generating a page render request to return as part of Post/Redirect/Get (see Forms example).</li>
	</ol>
	Neither situation applies to this page, so onPassivate() is unnecessary in this page.  However, by providing it we are  
	preparing the page for those two situations. (Maybe this is violating the 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAGNI">YAGNI</a> principle, but in practice it can prevent confusion later).<br/>

	<h4>Why are they package scoped?</h4>
	
	This is just a personal style choice. Strictly speaking, onActivate(...) and onPassivate(..) should be private scoped 
	because only Tapestry should call them, but then the compiler generates warnings that the methods are "unused".  Rather 
	than clutter the code with @SuppressWarnings("unused") annotations on the methods, in JumpStart we have taken the easy 
	way out and used package scope for these methods. This is a common convention in Tapestry for event handler methods too.<br/><br/>
	
	For completeness, here is the Person specified by the activation context given to this page:
	
	<div class="eg">
		<t:beandisplay object="person"/>
	</div>
