DO NOT MODIFY THE "COLLAPSED" DIRECTORY

-> The collapsed/ directory in this project is populated automatically by an Eclipse project builder
(open the project's properties and click on Builders - you will see that there is the usual Java Builder plus there is an 
Ant build file called collapser.xml which you'll find in the top level of the project).

-> Check that the collapsed/ directory, if it exists, has been flagged as "derived" (open the 
directory's properties and ensure that Derived is on).
